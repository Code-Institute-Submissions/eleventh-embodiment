# Eleventh Embodiment

Main purpose of this project was to build a website for my First Milestone Project as a part of Full Stack Web Developer Diploma course, using knowldge of HTML and CSS only.
I have decided to build a website for a friend of mine who is a yoga teacher and an alternative healer. Idea was to create a place where people can learn about different types of yoga, 
different healing techniques, and to be able to book yoga or healing sessions, workshop and retreats.
Website owner's goal is to attract more visitiors to the website wich will result in a bigger community, larger following on social media, and ultimately more people booking her classes, healing seassions or retreats.  

## UX
 
Idea was to create a website that will be easy to navigate and to encourage the user to explore all the pages to learn all about site owner's skills and experience. 
The site should be simple but elegant and bright wich should be accomplished white, gold and grey colors.

## Design 

 #### Typogroaphy 
 Google font Lato was used trought the website to achieve the elegantand clean look

#### Colors
  An off white shade #fafafa  was used for the text to contrast the gold #c4881be3 backgrounds.
  Same gold color was used for borders and titles as site owner wanted this to be main color.
  For the text, the grey hsla(38, 38%, 25%, 0.89) color was used for easier reading as a lot of backgrounds are white
  There was a need to use grey text shadow rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.281) on some titles and navigation menu for easier reading of gold letters.
